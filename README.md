## üìÑ Reason for Missing Final Documentation

At this stage, the project is still under active development. While the backend part is already complete, the frontend has not yet been implemented. Since the addition of the client-side will likely lead to changes in the API, user flows, and overall architecture, it was decided to **postpone writing the final documentation** until all core components of the system are finished.

This approach ensures that the final documentation will be accurate, up-to-date, and fully aligned with the finalized structure of the project.
